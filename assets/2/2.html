            This is a novel interface demo for an academic research audience, created by myself,
            Megan Prakash, Wuyahuang Li, and Kwan Queenie Li at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
            A paper on this project was published in <i>CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems ‘21:</i>

            Immersive virtual experiences are becoming more prominent in journalism,
            yet they largely focus on realistic simulations of the real world.
            We introduce a novel VR experience that incorporates surrealism and
            foregrounds the abstract concepts in the journalistic story of Occupy
            City Hall, the June 2020 sit-in protest in New York, NY.
        </p><p>
            There is much foundational work on what makes a compelling and friendly experience,
            but virtual reality nonfiction has many unexplored avenues, particularly in the
            realms of presenting abstract concepts and utilizing interaction modalities.
            This project presents our contribution to this space.
        </p><p>
            In short, we see the traditional journalism format as (1) photos or videos: an ethical visual representation of an event, and (2) writing: an authentic narrative that completes the story with the who, what, when, where, why, and how a narrative that can become complex and abstract, especially in the case of deeply woven social issues. We believe that new forms of immersive media can parallel this: (1) concrete visual media, including photogrammetry or videos from the event, to objectively reproduce the scene of an event, and (2) new forms of interaction to represent underlying concepts and histories.
            Our goal was to create an interface to explore Occupy City Hall media with the following traits:
            Foreground prominent themes that motivated the actions of protestors
            “Make the invisible visible,” as is the unique capability of VR and surrealism at large
            Present the user with an ambiguous interface with the opportunity to decipher it. Ambiguity has long been used in fine art practice and can lead a user towards deep conceptual understanding. Ambiguity in HCI also has the advantage of allowing “designers to engage users with issues without constraining how they respond” [1].
            Build a visually compelling environment with roots in fine art, as a means to explore novel interface design
            We believe that an ambiguous, concept-based interface can leverage the twin educational affordances of exploration and guidance, which combine to encourage users to reflect on and retain conceptual material. [6]

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>
            We received very positive responses with regards to the visual design and the ability to showcase a broad selection of primary sources. The exploration interface meant that many themes could be showcased without overtly choosing a primary narrative. Observers felt the space was engaging to experience and felt it had potential for sharing nuanced and balanced stories.
        </p><p>
            The most common critique was that the living room scene was too ambiguous and lacked guidance for the user to understand their task and track their progress. The pandemic prevented our ability to carry out further user studies at this time.
        </p><p>
            In conclusion, our project blended the ambiguous and definite in order to create an innovative interface to explore a concept-heavy journalistic narrative.
        </p><p>
            We express gratitude to Prof. D. Fox Harrell and Dr. Cagri Hakan Zaman of MIT for their class, which provided the education and opportunity to create this project.
