                    Immersive virtual experiences are becoming more prominent in journalism,
                    yet they largely focus on realistic simulations of the real world.
                    We introduce a novel VR experience that incorporates surrealism and
                    foregrounds the abstract concepts in the journalistic story of Occupy
                    City Hall, the June 2020 sit-in protest in New York, NY.
                </p><p>
                    There is much foundational work on what makes a compelling and friendly experience,
                    but virtual reality nonfiction has many unexplored avenues, particularly in the
                    realms of presenting abstract concepts and utilizing interaction modalities.
                    This project presents our contribution to this space.
                </p><p>
                    In short, we see the traditional journalism format as (1) photos or videos: an ethical visual representation of an event, and (2) writing: an authentic narrative that completes the story with the who, what, when, where, why, and how a narrative that can become complex and abstract, especially in the case of deeply woven social issues. We believe that new forms of immersive media can parallel this: (1) concrete visual media, including photogrammetry or videos from the event, to objectively reproduce the scene of an event, and (2) new forms of interaction to represent underlying concepts and histories.
                    Our goal was to create an interface to explore Occupy City Hall media with the following traits:
                    Foreground prominent themes that motivated the actions of protestors
                    “Make the invisible visible,” as is the unique capability of VR and surrealism at large
                    Present the user with an ambiguous interface with the opportunity to decipher it. Ambiguity has long been used in fine art practice and can lead a user towards deep conceptual understanding. Ambiguity in HCI also has the advantage of allowing “designers to engage users with issues without constraining how they respond” [1].
                    Build a visually compelling environment with roots in fine art, as a means to explore novel interface design
                    We believe that an ambiguous, concept-based interface can leverage the twin educational affordances of exploration and guidance, which combine to encourage users to reflect on and retain conceptual material. [6]
                </p><p>
                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>
                        We received very positive responses with regards to the visual design and the ability to showcase a broad selection of primary sources. The exploration interface meant that many themes could be showcased without overtly choosing a primary narrative. Observers felt the space was engaging to experience and felt it had potential for sharing nuanced and balanced stories.
                    </p><p>
                    The most common critique was that the living room scene was too ambiguous and lacked guidance for the user to understand their task and track their progress. The pandemic prevented our ability to carry out further user studies at this time.
                </p><p>
                    In conclusion, our project blended the ambiguous and definite in order to create an innovative interface to explore a concept-heavy journalistic narrative.

                <p><u>Binaural Koreas</u> is an audiovisual experiment on semi-fictional soundscape composition representing the political identities, conflicts, and reconciliation of the two Koreas. While examining the perceptual dimensions of peace in Korean peninsula, Ahn (2010) proposes co-construction of the ‘democratic we’ as opposed to the nationalist restoration of the original Korea. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between South and North Korea has been a battleground of sonic warfare, propaganda speakers blasting at each other, expressing the decades-long hatred, grief, distrust, and manipulation. How can this split be reconvened through sound? Seventy years of the divide between South and North Korea, are represented through the binaural split, the two speakers asserting their own territories yet resonating within a single stereophonic <i>place</i>.</p>
                <p>
                Among the wide range of propaganda operations targeted at each other, loudspeaker broadcasting, or direct broadcasting, involves enormous arrays of loudspeakers installed on both sides of the border. This sonic psyop started in 1967 and still operating whenever the political tension heightens, and it is known that each side operates about 40 units of speakers along the border. They are multiplied so that they are powerful enough to travel miles far, in order to permeate beyond border and even towards the civilian villages.
                </p>
                <p>
                The sound is accompanied by the moving image of the DMZ, a no man’s land that looks peaceful at first glance yet hiding thousands of landmines and bodies buried underneath, that is also where the natural biomes are thriving after being untouched by humans for decades.
                </p>
                <p>
                In the meantime, the sounds that are used in the broadcast, which are used as material for the soundscape composition, reveal in the most vulnerable way the state of affairs between the two Koreas. Bleiker (2001) observes the identities of two Koreas are largely constructed in negative terms to their opponents, South in terms of anti-communist, and North anti-democracy, anti-US sentiment. The identities of negativity, in the case of the South, has been merging with the neo-capitalist pop culture exemplified by K-pop songs in the past decade. The sounds represent the double reflection presented through the negative image of self-description of their own culture and ideologies. Then the placeness of DMZ is the representative of this stereophonic space, of two channels, North and South saturating a single sphere of perception.
